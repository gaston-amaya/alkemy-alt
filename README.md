# alkemy alternative challange
what i have done:
- added all tables and associations, displaying the info as requested
- added CRUD for all controllers
- added login and register so that only registered & logged in users can access the info in the controllers
- added basic validations like -unique name and checking empty fields
- when an user registers a welcome email gets sent to their registered address

what im missing:
- endpoint documentation + tests
- more validations & query filters
